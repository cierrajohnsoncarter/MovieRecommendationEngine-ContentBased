# MovieRecommendationEngine-ContentBased

In this python project, I built a content based movie recommendation engine that:

• Takes in a movie that a user likes and analyzes it to get that movie's content(genre, director, etc)

• Ranks which movies should be recommended based on how similar they are to the liked movie generated by similarity scores
